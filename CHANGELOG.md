## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install agraph
```

### Optional Dependencies

```bash
# Development tools
pip install agraph[dev]

# Documentation tools
pip install agraph[docs]

# All dependencies
pip install agraph[all]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from agraph import quick_build_graph, create_json_storage

# Build a knowledge graph
graph = quick_build_graph(
    texts=["Knowledge graphs represent structured information"],
    graph_name="my_graph"
)

# Save to JSON storage
storage = create_json_storage("./graphs")
storage.save_graph(graph)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Factory Pattern** - Consistent object creation across the framework
- **Strategy Pattern** - Multiple algorithms for graph building and processing
- **Plugin Architecture** - Easy extension with custom components
- **Abstract Base Classes** - Well-defined interfaces for all major components

## üìã Requirements

- **Python** - 3.10+ required
- **Core Dependencies** - BeautifulSoup4, LightRAG, OpenAI, PyPDF, Neo4j driver
- **Optional Dependencies** - Development and documentation tools

## üõ°Ô∏è Stability

This is the initial release (v0.1.0) of AGraph. While the core functionality is stable and well-tested, the API may evolve based on user feedback. We recommend pinning to specific versions in production environments.
